# NMAP

Run an NMAP scan against the targetmachineIP. [Nmap Info](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap)
```
nmap -sV targetmachineIP
```
+ `-sV`: Service/Version detection scan

We see that the following services are running:
  

`ssh` - port 22
  
`apache server` - port 80
  
Keep ssh in mind, lets check out the web server.

Looks like the standard apache page that is loaded after being installed.
  
Lets take a look at the page source.

We have a comment that was left behind for a user named Jessie!
  
  
# DIRB
 
Lets run a dirb scan. This will reveal any directories that might be useful. [Dirb Info](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirb/)

Dirb found quite a few directories, but only two seem interesting to me. /sitemap/ and /sitemap/.ssh/. Lets check them out!
  
/sitemap/ seems to be a rabbit hole.
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115602464/201540748-93d7b9b7-8c2b-44cd-a78c-a1699232874c.png)

/sitemap/.ssh/ contains a file named id_rsa, if we open it up we can see its an RSA private key! 
  
We can use this id_rsa file with ssh to show we have the private key for a specific user. Copy the private key(everything on the page, including the dashes) and save it to your attackbox. Make sure you name it id_rsa.
  
# SSH

Lets try and use this id_rsa file for the user Jessie. No one users are known to us at this time. [SSH Info](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh)
  
`ssh targetmachineIP -i id_rsa`

+ `-i`: "Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or DSA authentication is read."

The id_rsa file is in the present working directory of my terminal so I didnt need to specify the path.

We are given an error telling us our private keys cant be accessible by others. Lets chmod the file to remove any permissions from group/other.
  
`chmod 0600 id_rsa`

+ `0600`: This gives owner r/w, and group/others NO permissions.
  
Do a quick `ls -la` to make certain the permissions are properly set. You should see "-rw-------" permissions for id_rsa.
  
Re-run our ssh command again.

We're in as Jessie!
  
If we run `ls *`, we can see the user_flag.txt inside the Documents folder!ðŸš©

# GTFObins
  

After looking around a little, there don't seem to be any useful files.
  
Lets check our sudo permissions! `sudo -l`
  
This shows us what we're able to run as root using sudo.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115602464/201542491-a39cd09a-0674-44ab-b87f-c9aaa7db5876.png)

Looks like we've been given sudo permissions for the wget bin. [Wget Info](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget)
  
Head over to GTFObins, and search for wget.

We can see there are a few different methods for wget. The one we will be using is "File read".

# WGET
  
Most root flags are in the root home directory. If we follow the naming convention of the user flag we found earlier, we are trying to read root_flag.txt.
  
Remember, we want to run wget with sudo to get the elevated permissions, otherwise we won't be able to access anything in the root directory.
  
We can skip creating a variable and just use the full file path.
  
`sudo wget -i /root/root_flag.txt`
  
+ `-i`: Allows us to specify files we want to use as URL inputs.
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115602464/201542861-51046a37-555a-449a-8368-ff42011e6395.png)

  
We have the root flag!ðŸš©
  
The output looks funny, because wget is using the contents of root_flag.txt as a web address.
  
These long strings are, of course, not valid URLs.
