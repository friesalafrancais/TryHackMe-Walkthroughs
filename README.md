# TryHackMe-Walkthroughs
> https://tryhackme.com


After going through THM for a few months I decided to create a repo with walkthroughs that contain ALL steps.
I noticed that many walkthroughs assume the reader has similar knowledge/experience as the writer...this is unrealistic thinking.
I aim to provide step-by-step walkthroughs so that virtually ANYONE can follow along. 
I assume the reader understands basic commands in Linux and is comfortable using THM through their AttackBox or OpenVPN.

Each room has its own read-me file which is found above. Find the one you need for your room to get started!
